1. Install node on your machine. Node can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en
2. Clone the repo into your local machine.
3. In the directory of the repo, run the following command: `npm install` (I think install Node would already install the `npm` CLI but I can be wrong).
4. To run the script, run the following command: `npm run script`
5. Note: The `script.ts` file looks for the file name `2024 Job Tracker - Sheet3.csv` and defaults the output file name as `output.csv`. Feel free to change the names to whatever you'd like on your local machine.
